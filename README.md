# Brain Tumor Detection and Alzheimer's Detection using Deep Learning, FastAPI, and React

# Overview
This project leverages the power of Deep Learning, FastAPI, and React to detect and classify brain tumors from medical imaging data. Brain tumors are a critical health concern, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Our integrated solution provides a user-friendly interface for medical professionals to upload MRI images, perform tumor detection, and receive accurate results in real-time.

# Key Features
- Deep Learning Model: We have trained a state-of-the-art deep learning model using a large dataset of MRI scans to accurately identify and classify brain tumors.

- FastAPI Backend: Our FastAPI backend serves as the core of the application, handling image uploads, processing, and communication with the deep learning model. It ensures fast and secure data transfer.

- React Frontend: The React-based frontend offers an intuitive and responsive user interface. Medical professionals can easily upload MRI images, initiate tumor detection, and visualize the results.

- Real-time Results: Users receive real-time feedback on whether a tumor is detected, its location, and an initial assessment of its severity.

- Data Privacy: We prioritize data privacy and security. Patient data is handled with care and is not stored beyond the duration of the session.
